## Objectives

* To demonstrate how to insert and retrieve data using the object mapper described in the documentation [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/nodejs-driver/4.3/features/mapper/)
  
## Project Layout

* app.js - The main application file which contains the example code for using the object mapper

## How this Sample Works
A description of how this sample works and how it demonstrates the objectives outlined above

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites
The prerequisites required for this application to run

e.g.
* NodeJs version 8
* A DSE 6.7 Cluster
* Schema added to the cluster

### Running
The steps and configuration needed to run and build this application

e.g.
To run this application use the following command:

`node app.js`

This will produce the following output:

`Connected to cluster with 3 host(s) ["XX.XX.XX.136:9042","XX.XX.XX.137:9042","XX.XX.XX.138:9042"]`
